# CausalNET

This repository provides the source code and appendix for CausalNET (IJCAI'24).

## Environments
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Experiments
Execute the following steps to replicate our results on the two real datasets (i.e., Micro-24 and Micro-25):
```shell
cd ./model
conda activate python_envs_name
## before running the following commands, please replace the directory path in '...' by your own settings
## '...': Main.py: line22 & line24
python -u main.py -g 1 -task test_M24 -opt ./configs/config_m24.yaml
python -u main.py -g 2 -task test_M25 -opt ./configs/config_m25.yaml
```

```txt
Note: 
(1) the DAG (causal graph) files will be saved in the subdirectory named './dags/final_prob/'.
(2) the DAG file for 'dataset_name' will be named as 'dataset_name_i.npy'.
```

Based on the hyper-parameter settings we provided, the estimated training duration for CausalNET is expected to be 2ï½ž6 hours (depending on the status of the hardware devices).
